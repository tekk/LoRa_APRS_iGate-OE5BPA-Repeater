## Supported boards

You can use one of the Lora32 boards without changings:

* Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V1 (433MHz SX1278)
* Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V2 (433MHz SX1278)
* TTGO LoRa32 V1 (433MHz SX1278)
* TTGO LoRa32 V2 (433MHz SX1278)
* TTGO LoRa32 V2.1 (433MHz SX1278)
* TTGO T-Beam V0.7 (433MHz SX1278)
* TTGO T-Beam V1 (433MHz SX1278)
* Tracker D from [OE1ACM and OE1CGC](https://www.lora-aprs.at/)
* and sure many more...

Here are some amazon-de links for some example boards:
* [LoRa32 V1](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07VPHYYJD)
* [LoRa32 V1](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07QRG89ZV)
* [LoRa32 V2](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07VL97VNH)
* [LoRa32 V2.1](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07RXSKPBX)
* [T-Beam V1.0](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07RT9FKPL)

This boards cost around 20 Euros, they are very cheap and perfect for an LoRa iGate.
Keep in minde: you need a 433MHz version!

## Compiling and configuration

**There is a german [quick start](https://www.lora-aprs.info/docs/LoRa_APRS_iGate/quick-start-guide/) page! Take a look ;)**

### How to compile

The best success is to use PlatformIO (and it is the only platform where I can support you). 

* Go to [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) download and install the IDE. 
* If installed open the IDE, go to the left side and klick on 'extensions' then search for 'PatformIO' and install.
* When installed click 'the ant head' on the left and choose import the project on the right.
* Just open the folder and you can compile the Firmware.

### Configuration

* You can find all nessesary settings to change for your configuration in **data/is-cfg.json**.
* To upload it to your board you have to do this via **Upload File System image** in PlatformIO!
* To find the 'Upload File System image' click the PlatformIO symbol (the little alien) on the left side, choos your configuration, click on 'Platform' and search for 'Upload File System image'.

## Branches in this repository and version system

This firmware is developed in a rolling release system: everyday a new release could be created. But there are still rules where new pull requests has to go and and how the version system looks like.

### Branches

There are 2 main branches:
* *master* and
* *develop*

The *master* branch has all releases and is the most stable one. With the different tags you can jump to different versions or if you take the most current *master* branch you will just get the latest, stable version. There will be no side releases which are branched of from *master*. If there is a bugfix version it will be done directly on the *master* branch and a tag will be generated with a new version.

The *develop* branch is used for new feature development. It will be also used to stabilize the current development to create a new stable version (pull request to *master* branch). **Again:** all new development (pull requests) has to go directly into the *develop* branch!

### Version system

If the *develop* branch is stable enough for a new release it will be merged with a pull request to the *master* branch and a new version will be generated.

The versions are based on this settings:
* major: the current year (2 digits)
* minor: the current week of the year
* patch: if there is a important fix for an release, just increment the number, otherwise 0

*example*: a new release will be created on the 11/14/2020, this version numbers will be used: 
* major: 20
* minor: 46
* patch: 0

so the version will be: 20.46.0

## Future plans

* [x] show time until next beaconing
* [ ] show login issues from IS server
* [ ] add better OLED library to support multiple different OLEDs
* [x] add support to turn OLED on, off and dimming
* [ ] add support for temperature chips (BMExxx)
* [x] add FTP server support to upload configuration
* [ ] add web server for configuration and other things
* [ ] add statistics for received packages
* [ ] show received packages on a map
* [ ] etc.

## LoRa Tracker

Look at my other project: a [LoRa Tracker](https://github.com/peterus/LoRa_APRS_Tracker)

## Hints

### Here are some peculiarities of the different boards

* TTGO T-Beam V1

When adding a 0,96" OLED display direct to the board you have to be careful, there are two different pinout
versions on the market. 
For direct mount you need a display with this Pinout -> [VCC - GND - SCL - SDA](pics/display-right.jpg).
A direct mount of the [other display](pics/display-wrong.jpg) is not possible without damage the display!
The 'wrong' display works too but you have to change VCC and GND by wire !

feel free to add hints!
